## Research Methodology
Team's approach included:

Primary Research: In-depth interviews with stakeholders (vendors, customers, delivery personnel) and experts.

Secondary Research: Literature reviews, case studies (like inDriver), and analysis of online platform dynamics.

Field Research: Immersion trips, surveys, and semantic analysis to understand stakeholders' perspectives and challenges.

## Development Process
The development phase involved:

(1) Identifying key pain points through various research methods.

(2) Brainstorming and designing features that address these issues.

(3) Full-stack development of the three apps, integrating front-end usability with complex back-end functionalities.

## Design and Features
Our solution bridges the gap in the market with the following features:

(1) Competitive Pricing: A bargaining feature allows customers to get products at competitive prices.

(2) Quality Assurance: Ratings and reviews for each seller ensure the quality of products.

(3) Trustworthy and Prompt Delivery: Prioritization of sellers within a 2km radius fosters trust and ensures fast delivery.

(4) Accessibility: A multi-language option makes the app accessible to diverse sellers.

(5) Digital Marketplace: Sourcing produce directly from local vendors provides them with a platform to expand their reach.

(6) Local Insights: Vendors receive analytics on hot products and buying patterns in their locality through the app.

These features are the keystones of Yotta Expo, conceptualized to empower local vendors by providing them with tools previously available only to large companies.

## Key Insights

Understanding the importance of online platforms in traditional merchants' market reach without heavy investment.

Identification of vendors' challenges, such as lack of resources for timely deliveries, high commissions by large companies, and difficulties in scaling their businesses.
