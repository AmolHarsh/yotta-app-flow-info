This repo contains past, present, and new development information related to Yotta Expo.

## Overview
Yotta Expo is a pioneering app designed to empower local street cart vendors, enabling them to enhance sales and effectively compete with major online delivery services. This comprehensive project, comprising a trio of interconnected apps (for vendors, customers, and delivery agents), was developed through extensive research and full-stack development skills, addressing specific challenges faced by vendors in the rapidly evolving marketplace.

The project demonstrated the **impact of leveraging digital tools** to empower local vendors, enabling them to compete against quick e-commerce businesses that pose a significant threat to their livelihoods in India. Through innovative solutions, Yotta Expo not only boosted vendor revenue but also reduced wastage (for sellers selling perishable items like fruits and vegetables), ensuring sustainable business growth.

The app has successfully been launched on both the **Google Play Store** and **Apple App Store** in India. It demonstrated significant impact during testing and deployment in **Prayagraj (2023)** with 5 local vendors and in **Chandigarh (2024)** with 2 local vendors, achieving a **20% increase in vendor revenue** and a **50% reduction in fruit and vegetable wastage**.

## Research Methodology
Team's approach included:
- **Primary Research**: In-depth interviews with stakeholders (vendors, customers, delivery personnel) and experts.
- **Secondary Research**: Literature reviews, case studies (like inDriver), and analysis of online platform dynamics.
- **Field Research**: Immersion trips, surveys, and semantic analysis to understand stakeholders' perspectives and challenges.

## Development Process
The development phase involved:
1. Identifying key pain points through various research methods.
2. Brainstorming and designing features that address these issues.
3. Full-stack development of the three apps, integrating front-end usability with complex back-end functionalities.

## Design and Features
Our solution bridges the gap in the market with the following features:
1. Competitive Pricing: A bargaining feature allows customers to get products at competitive prices.
2. Quality Assurance: Ratings and reviews for each seller ensure the quality of products.
3. Trustworthy and Prompt Delivery: Prioritization of sellers within a 2km radius fosters trust and ensures fast delivery.
4. Accessibility: A multi-language option makes the app accessible to diverse sellers.
5. Digital Marketplace: Sourcing produce directly from local vendors provides them with a platform to expand their reach.
6. Local Insights: Vendors receive analytics on hot products and buying patterns in their locality through the app.

## Key Insights
- Recognition of the profitability of daily deal businesses in developing economies.
- Understanding the importance of online platforms in traditional merchants' market reach without heavy investment.
- Identification of vendors' challenges, such as lack of resources for timely deliveries, high commissions by large companies, and difficulties in scaling their businesses.
